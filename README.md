# Eloquent JavaScript

In pursuit of strengthening the fundamentals of programming and a deep dive into the JavaScript language, I decided to complete the Eloquent JavaScript book from front to back.

Organized by section, based on appearance in the chapters of the book, Here are solutions to exercises and projects that I've completed:

#### Program Structure
  - [Looping a Triangle](./program_structure/looping_a_triangle.js)
  - [FizzBuzz](./program_structure/fizzbuzz.js)
  - [Chessboard](./program_structure/chessboard.js)

#### Functions
  - [Minimum](./functions/minimum.js)
  - [Recursion](./functions/recursion.js)
  - [Bean Counting](./functions/bean_counting.js)
